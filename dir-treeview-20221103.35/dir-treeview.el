;;; Commentary:

;; Displays the file system as a tree; subtrees can be folded and unfolded
;; A click on a filename loads the file in Emacs
;; A right-click opens a context menu with further actions
;; Can open files by external programs or Lisp functions
;; Can open terminal in directory
;; Can copy, delete, and move files
;; Provides selection of multiple files to operate on them
;; Works in text mode, too
;; Supports file notifications
;; Highly customizable
;; Themable
;; Ships with one theme called "Pleasant" using Font Awesome icons
